Version 0.1 (02005-10-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Not yet a public release, but the first "quite usable"
release. Some positive remarks:
 - A 'LuaState' class nicely encapsulating the Lua state.
 - A 'LuaValue' class that approximates in C++ most valid Lua values.
 - A 'LuaVariable' class that provides easy read/write access to
   variables stored in a Lua state.
 - Quite complete unit tests.
 - Pretty well documented.
 - No known bugs.
 - Just four TODOs. Three are related to possible performance
   improvements. The other one concerns some code duplication. So,
   there are no really big issues.
 - As a bonus, there are two "pure Lua" packages: one with console
   tricks (changing font color, positioning the cursor and so on) and
   a command-line options parser.
But some things are still missing, most notably:
 - Testing with other compilers/platforms (other than GCC under Linux).
 - Improving the 'SConstruct' and directory structure so that it looks
   like a real library, not a bunch of files.
 - And the big thing: a good (but not necessarily excellent) way to
   call C++ from Lua.
