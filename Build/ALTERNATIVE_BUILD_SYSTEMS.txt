 diluculum.cbp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Project for the Code Blocks IDE. Contributed by Hakki Dogusan. (When
he sent me the file, it was in a .zip file, buried in some directory
structure. I'm distributing only the .cbp file. I hope this file can
be easily used as I'm distributing it -- I don't know this IDE.)
