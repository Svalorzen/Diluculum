 diluculum.cbp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Project for the Code Blocks IDE. Contributed by Hakki Dogusan. (When
he sent me the file, it was in a .zip file, buried in some directory
structure. I'm distributing only the .cbp file. I hope this file can
be easily used as I'm distributing it -- I don't know this IDE.)

 CMakeLists.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preliminary build system based on CMake. Currently, it doesn't handle
the unit tests very well nor does it look for Lua paths, but when it
does, it'll probably become the oficial way to build Diluculum.
